A message from the developer

I hope you found this game fun.
I spent a whole day and a long night writing this game.
It took a bunch of troubleshooting to get this to run.
This may be surprise you but, the speech engine support was very easy to implement.
the hard part was getting the object tracking, until, and if commands to work right.

Why?
I started making this game to push my BASH skills.
I also wanted to say that I programmed an escape game in BASH!
using my knowledge of BASH and a programming tricks I originally learned while programming
my GTKtools and GTKfindit programs, I tackled another BASH challenge. a text based escape game!
with text to speech support as well!
